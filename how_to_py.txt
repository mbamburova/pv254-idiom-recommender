# pre-requirements
- My setup
python --version => Pyhton 3.7.1
pip --version => pip 18.1
virtualenv --version => 16.0.0

# always use virtual environment
- go to $PROJECT_FOLDER/
run '$PROJECT_FOLDER/venv/Scripts/activate' => Command activate virtual environment
run 'deactivate' to deactivate environment

# installing packages 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# if you install new package, then add it to requirements
pip freeze > requirements.txt

*PyCharm uses virtual environment automatically in terminal window
	
HEROKU
In order to deploy to heroku:
- 'gunicorn' package, already in requirements.txt
- heroku scans through code and figure out, which db it uses, but it has to configured in Procfile below
- file 'Procfile'
	* each line has format '<process type>: <command>'
	* in our case 'web: gunicorn app:app'
	* for more info: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile
	* add line for db config 'release: python migrate.py db upgrade' and heroku populates db automatically. If you don't want to use migrations, then please suggest other solution
